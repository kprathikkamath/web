  <p>More or less we all know deep inside the adverse effects of deforestion &amp; modernization that have swept up our dear brjbhoomi rendering it a place where if people without having a bhaav of love to Lord Shri Krshna &amp; Srimati Radharani would not care to make a second trip .It is even more saddening to hear that villagers in and around vrndavan have adopted modern agricultural practises leading to crops having lesser virya &amp; carcinogenics laden onto them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;We recognizing the urgent need to preserve its sanctity from the pollution that it is prone to from neighbouring city such as Delhi, have taken up an effort to plan &amp; execute a project that has a potential to enrich the nature , protect the indegeneous cows , various kunds by employing a technique that can parallely generate a source of income to brjvasis (residents of vrndavan) thus preventing the youths from falling into the clutches of urban sprawl. Making the people realise that their old lifestyle of farming , rearing cows ,a simple living with high thinking which all great stalwarts leaders of Sanathana &nbsp;Dharma like Srila Prabhupada had propounded. This mission is not only an act of Guru Seva but also a hardcore step to save&nbsp; our nation from farsighted danger that&rsquo;s just appearing far away but speeding very very near day by day.</p>
  <p>Now even before I describe the solution , let me first highlight the problem as many don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s a reality now . Many even think we are exaggerating the present situation.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Carcinogenic content in water as tested in lab</li>
  <li>SOM(soil organic matter) being at less than -2</li>
  <li>Youths unemployed</li>
  <li>Deforested hills in and around vrndavan which were grazing lands for more than 9 lakh cows which were owned by Lord Shri Krshna alone , so just have a guess to what extend we have lost the riches.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>But don&rsquo;t get disheartened , this method is tried and tested with cent percent success !!!</p>
  <p>We intend to bring this to life by these various activites as follows :</p>
